# Chess

Source code for my online chess board, comprising of two Arduino libraries: Chess, for control of the chess board itself; and ChessSerial, for communicating with the Raspberry Pi webserver that hosts the web interface. 
Also included is the webserver code, which includes the Python data handling files and the javascript, which makes use of the wonderful [Chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/blob/master/README.md) and [chessboard.js](http://chessboardjs.com) libraries.

In addition I have included my 3D printed chess piece STL files. They have a hexagonal recess in the bottom to allow for the circuitry.
